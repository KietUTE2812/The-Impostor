# 🕵️ How to Play: The Word Impostor

## 1. Game Objective

| Role | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| **The Players (Crewmates)** | Must work together to identify and vote out the Impostor |
| **The Impostor** | Must hide their identity, pretend to know the secret Keyword, and survive the final vote |

---

## 2. Setup

### Players
**4 to 8 players** are required.

### Assign Roles
The game will secretly assign **one player** to be the **Impostor**. All other players are **Crewmates**.

### Distribute Words

1. The system selects one **Category** (e.g., "Animals") and one secret **Keyword** from that category (e.g., "Penguin")
2. **Everyone** is shown the **Category** ("Animals")
3. **Crewmates** are also shown the secret **Keyword** ("Penguin")
4. **The Impostor** does **not** know the Keyword, only the Category

---

## 3. Gameplay (The Rounds)

The game is played over **several rounds** (e.g., 3 rounds, depending on the player count).

- In each round, **every player takes a turn** saying **one single word** that relates to the Keyword
- The turn order may be shuffled each round

### Faction Strategies

#### 🛡️ Crewmates

**Task**: You must say a word that is related enough to the Keyword (e.g., "swim", "Antarctica", "black-and-white") to prove to other Crewmates that you are "in the know."

> ⚠️ **Caution**: Do not say a word that is **too obvious** (e.g., "bird" or "penguin"). If you do, the Impostor will hear it and easily guess the secret Keyword.

#### 🎭 Impostor

**Task**: You only know the Category ("Animals"). You must listen carefully to the words other players say to try and guess what they are all describing.

**Act**: When it's your turn, you must say a "safe" or "plausible" word to blend in.

> 💡 **Example**: After hearing others say "swim" and "black-and-white," the Impostor might make an educated guess and say "whale" (which also swims and has those colors) to hide their identity.

## 4. Voting

After all rounds are complete, the game enters the **discussion and voting phase**.

1. Players will debate who gave the "strangest" or most suspicious-sounding words
2. Each player casts **one vote** for the person they believe is the Impostor

## 5. Winning

| Outcome | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| **🎉 The Crewmates Win** | If the player who receives the most votes is correctly identified as the Impostor |
| **😈 The Impostor Wins** | If the player voted out is a Crewmate (meaning the Impostor successfully fooled everyone) |
